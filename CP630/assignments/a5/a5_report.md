There is a company named Twilio that handles communications for enterprises. Its API's allow developers to integrate text, voice, and video-based communications into their applications. As of right now, this is helping the pandemic by changing customer engagement to digital channels. Alaska Airlines is using Twilio to send boarding passes over SMS, reducing agents' potential exposure to any viruses. For the future, Twilio will foster more personalized communications which it can do by integrating customer data tools into its API's. Twilio is already integrated into DoorDash, Yelp, Airbnb, Uber and many more companies which may revolutionize how enterprises may communicate and engage with clients or customers.
